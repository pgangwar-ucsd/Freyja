# Lineages: (Lineages key makes changes to the "Lineages" and "Load Scaled Lineages" plot. The Lineages is optional.)
#   key1:
#    name: "Lineage 1" (The name key changes the name on the legend on the graph.)
#    members:
#     - member1 (The lineages under the members key will be aggreagated to gether and represented as a single plot on the graph.)
#     - member2* (Added a '*' to the end of the lineage name indicates that the sub-lineages of that lineage have to be included too.)
#    color: "red" (The color key changes the color of the plot on the graph.)
# VOC: (VOC key makes changes to the "VOC plot" and "Load Scaled Summary" plot. The VOC key is optional.)

# Please refer to https://github.com/cov-lineages/lineages-website/blob/master/data/lineages.yml
# to see the relationship between lineages.
# Note: if 2 keys in the 'Lineages' key have overlapping members, the one with the highest priority will be used.
# The priority is determined by the order of the keys in the 'Lineages' key.
